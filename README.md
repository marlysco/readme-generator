 ## Professional README Generator

 ## Description:
 When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This project goal was to create a Professional README file by using a command-line application that dynamically generates it from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
